## The History of MultiBit Wallet 
Multibit was established in 2011 by two developers, Jim Burton and Gary Rowe. 

Gary Rowe provides an idea of the environment under which Multibit was established. He says that since they established MultiBit, there had been many Bitcoin “booms and busts.” This had led some to declare that Bitcoin was dead. 

Rowe also says that when MultiBit came into the scene in July 2011, there were very few Bitcoin wallets and services. He reports that Instawallet was only three months old at this time. Instawallet provided Bitcoin owners with a way to create Bitcoin wallets. It shut down in 2013 following a hacking incident.

Rowe notes that when MultiBit started, the June 2011 Mt. Gox incident was still fresh in many Bitcoin owners’ minds. Mt. Gox was a popular Bitcoin exchange. In June 2011, VentureBeat.com reported that Mt. Gox had admitted that its servers had been hacked. Mt.Gox made the announcement after the price of Bitcoin had fallen from around $17.50 to almost nothing within minutes.
